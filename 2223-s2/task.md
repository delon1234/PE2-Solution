# CS2030S AY22/23 Sem 2
## Practical Assessment II (Session I @ 12 PM)

April 2023
Time Allowed 90 minutes

## INSTRUCTIONS TO CANDIDATES

1. This practical assessment consists of **one** question. The total mark
   is 20: 2 marks for design; 2 for style; 16 for correctness.  Style and
   correctness are given on the condition that reasonable efforts have been
   made to solve the given tasks.

2. This is an OPEN BOOK assessment. You are only allowed to refer to
   written/printed notes. No online resources/digital documents are
   allowed, except those accessible from the PE nodes (e.g., man pages are
   allowed).

3. You should see the following files/directories in your home directory.
   - `Bank.java`, `Account.java`, `Customer.java`, and `Pair.java` are for
     you to edit and solve the given task.
   - `pristine`, that contains a clean copy of the files above for your
     reference.
   - `test.jar` for testing your code.
   - `cs2030s/fp`, that contains the cs2030s.fp package, including
     `Maybe.java`.
   - `StreamAPI.md` and `MapAPI.md`, for references to Java's Stream and
     Map API.

4. Solve the programming tasks by editing `Bank.java`, `Account.java`, and
   `Customer.java`. You can leave the files in your home directory and log
   off after the assessment is over. There is no separate step to submit
   your code.

5. Only the files directly in your home directory will be graded. Do not
   put your code under a subdirectory.

6. Write your student number on top of EVERY FILE you edited as part of the
   `@author` tag. Do not write your name.

7. To compile your code, run `javac -Xlint:unchecked -Xlint:rawtypes
   *.java`.  You can also compile the files individually if you wish.

8. You can run each test individually.  For instance, to run `Test1`:

``` 
java -cp test.jar:. Test1
```

**IMPORTANT:** If the submitted classes `Bank.java`, `Account.java`, and
`Customer.java` cannot be compiled, 0 marks will be given for the
corresponding task.  Make sure your program compiles by running
```
	javac -Xlint:unchecked -Xlint:rawtypes *.java
```
before submission.

You have been given three classes `Bank`, `Account`, and `Customer`.

### Customer

Each `Customer` has a name and an address.  Customers can change their
names and their addresses using the `changeName` and `changeAddress`
methods respectively.

### Account

An `Account` keeps track of an account number, the account balance, one or
more account owners, and a boolean flag to indicate if the account has been
closed.

An account can have money deposited into it with the `deposit` method and
withdrawn from it using the `withdraw` method.

Money can also be transferred between two bank accounts using the
`transferTo` method.  An account can have a negative balance.

Two `Account`s can be combined with the `combine` method.  The combined
`Account` has a combined list of owners and an account balance that is the
sum of the two accounts combined.  The account number of the combined
account is the account number of the first account.

### Bank

The `Bank` class keeps track of accounts using a `Map` class, with account
numbers as keys.

The method `allAccounts` returns a string listing all the accounts in the
bank; The method `totalMoneyInBank` computes the total amount of money in
the bank (excluding closed accounts).

You can close an account using the `closeAccount` method.

You can `deposit` and `withdraw` money to a specific account.

Money can be transferred between two bank accounts using the `transfer`
method.  Both accounts must not be closed.  If one or both of the accounts
is/are closed, the method does nothing.  The account to transfer money from
must have a positive balance.  Otherwise, the method does nothing.

Finally, a closed account can be combined into a non-closed account with
`combineBankAccount`.  If the account to be combined from is not closed, or
the account to be combined into is closed, the method does nothing.  If the
methods above are applied to a non-existing account, the methods do
nothing.

You should read through the files `Account.java`, `Customer.java`, and
`Bank.java` to understand what methods they have, the parameters and return
value of the methods, and their behavior in detail.

The accounts are stored using a `Map` (a collection of key-value pairs) as
you have seen in Exercise 5: `Maybe`. The keys in a map are unique, so you
cannot have duplicate keys.

To put a key-value pair into a map `m` use `m.put(K key, V value)`, and to
remove a key-value pair from a map `m` use `remove(Object key)`.

Although `Map` may throw exceptions, you do not have to handle exceptions
and may assume that all test cases will not cause exceptions.

### Task 1 (4 marks)

#### Rewrite `Account.java` and `Customer.java` classes to be immutable.

All methods that mutate the class should return a new object.  You are not
allowed to add new methods in `Account.java` and `Customer.java`.

As `Account` is dependent on `Customer` we advise that you start by
modifying the `Customer` class first, followed by the `Account` class.
Make small changes at a time and make sure that your code compiles after
every change.

Note that for `Account::transfer`, you are expected to return a `Pair` of
accounts `(first, second)` such that `first` corresponds to the current
account and `second` corresponds to the `toAccount` after the transfer.

The tests `Test1` and `Test2` will test the immutability of
`Customer.java`, and `Account.java` respectively.

Note that the given skeleton does not correctly pass all these tests.
As in previous labs and PE1, make sure all OO principles, including LSP,
tell-don't-ask, and information hiding, are adhered to, where applicable.

### Task 2 (12 marks)

#### Remove all loops, conditional statements, and `null` from `Bank`

The `Bank` class has multiple methods that have loops, conditional
statements, and `null`.

Remove these from the methods in `Bank.java`, except from `Bank::equals`,
whilst retaining all of the functionality of `Bank.java`,
You may use Java `Stream` and our `Maybe` to achieve this result.

Note that you are also not allowed to use block statements in your lambdas
and you are not allowed to add new methods in `Bank.java`.  For instance,
the following is not allowed `x.map(x -> { .. })`.

To begin, you must change the return type of `findAccount` into
`Maybe<Account>`.

Make small changes at a time and make sure that your code compiles after
every change.

The last test `Test3` will test the functionality of `Bank.java`.  It
correctly works on the mutable implementation you have been given.
