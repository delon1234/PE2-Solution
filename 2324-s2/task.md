## INSTRUCTIONS TO CANDIDATES

1. The total mark is 45.  We may deduct up to 4 marks for violating of style.

2. This is a CLOSED-BOOK assessment. You are only allowed to refer to one
   double-sided A4-size paper.

3. You should see the following files/directories in your home directory.

   * Named.java, Perishable.java, Fruit.java, FruitStall.java and 
     Q4.java - Q8.java are for you to edit and solve the given task.

   * test.jar for testing your code.

   * Test1.jsh, Test2.jsh, Test3.jsh, and Fruits.jsh are code snippets to 
     help with interactive testing using jshell.  

   * StreamAPI.md and ListAPI.md, for references to Java's Stream and List 
     API.

4. You can leave the files in your home directory and log off after the
   assessment is over. There is no separate step to submit your code.

5. Only the files directly under your home directory will be graded. Do not
   put your code under a subdirectory.

6. Write your student number on top of EVERY FILE you created or edited as
   part of the `@author` tag. Do not write your name.

7. To compile your code, run 

   javac -Xlint:unchecked -Xlint:rawtypes *.java

   You can also compile the files individually if you wish.

## Question 1 (4 marks)

Write a Java functional interface `Perishable` with a method
`getDaysToExpiry` that returns the number of days to expiry of a perishable
item. The method should return an integer.

Write another Java functional interface `Named` with a method `getName`
that returns the name of an item. The method should return a string.

## Question 2 (6 marks)

Write a Java class `Fruit` that has two fields: `nameFunc` of type `Named`
and `expiryFunc` of type `Perishable`.

The class should have (i) a constructor that takes two parameters:
`nameFunc` and `expiryFunc`, and (ii) three methods: `getName` that returns
the name of the fruit, `getDaysToExpiry` that returns the number of days to
expiry of the fruit, and `toString` that returns a string representation of
the fruit.

Write your class so that it behaves as follows:

```
jshell> /open Named.java
jshell> /open Perishable.java
jshell> /open Fruit.java

jshell> new Fruit(() -> "Apple", () -> 5)
$.. ==> Apple (expires in 5 days)

jshell> new Fruit(() -> "Apple", () -> 5).getName()
$.. ==> "Apple"

jshell> new Fruit(() -> "Apple", () -> 5).getDaysToExpiry()
$.. ==> 5
```

Make sure that your `toString` method returns *exactly* the same output as
above.

**IMPORTANT:** For the rest of this paper, all methods written should
follow the following constraints:

- The method body must consist of a single return statement.
- The method body must not contain any loop or conditional statement.
- The method body must not use any lambda expression with blocks (e.g., `()
  -> { .. }`.)

Useful APIs are provided in the files `ListAPI.md` and `StreamAPI.md`.

Three classes representing apple, banana, and devil's fruit, have been
created in the file `Fruits.jsh` for your convenience.  The jshell code
given below uses these three classes.

## Question 3 (6 marks)

Write a generic class `FruitStall<T>`, where `T` is a subtype of `Fruit`.
The class has a field of type `List<T>` that keeps track of the list of
fruits sold at the stall.

The class should have two constructors: (i) one that takes a list of fruits
and stores it in the `fruits` field, and (ii) one that takes in no
arguments and initializes the list of fruits to an empty list.

The class should have a method `getFruits` that returns the list of fruits
sold at the stall.

The class also provides two methods: `findFruitsByName` that takes a string
`name` and returns a list of fruits with the given name, and `toString`
that returns the string representation of the list of fruits sold at the
stall.

Write your class so that it behaves as follows:

```
jshell> /open Named.java
jshell> /open Perishable.java
jshell> /open Fruit.java
jshell> /open FruitStall.java

jshell> /open Fruits.jsh

jshell> new FruitStall<String>()
|  Error:
|  type argument java.lang.String is not within bounds of type-variable T
|  new FruitStall<String>(); // Compilation error
|                 ^----^

jshell> new FruitStall<Fruit>(List.of(
   ...>       new Fruit(() -> "Apple", () -> 4),
   ...>       new Fruit(() -> "Banana", () -> 1)))
$.. ==>
- Apple (expires in 4 days)
- Banana (expires in 1 days)

jshell> List<Apple> apples = List.of(new Apple(2), new Apple(5))
apples ==> [Apple (expires in 2 days), Apple (expires in 5 days)]

jshell> new FruitStall<Apple>(apples)
$.. ==>
- Apple (expires in 2 days)
- Apple (expires in 5 days)

jshell> new FruitStall<Fruit>(apples)
$.. ==>
- Apple (expires in 2 days)
- Apple (expires in 5 days)

jshell> List<Fruit> list = new FruitStall<Fruit>(apples).getFruits()
list ==> [Apple (expires in 2 days), Apple (expires in 5 days)]

jshell> List<Fruit> list = List.of(new Mango(), new Apple(5), new Mango())
list ==> [Mango (expires in 4 days), Apple (expires in 5 days), Mango (expires in 4 days)]

jshell> new FruitStall<>(list).findFruitsByName("Apple")
$.. ==> [Apple (expires in 5 days)]

jshell> new FruitStall<>(list).findFruitsByName("Banana")
$18 ==> []

jshell> new FruitStall<>(list).findFruitsByName("Mango")
$19 ==> [Mango (expires in 4 days), Mango (expires in 4 days)]
```

Make sure that your `toString` method returns *exactly* the same output as
above.

## Question 4 (6 marks)

Write a static generic method `mergeStalls` in the class `Q4` that takes
two fruit stalls as arguments and returns a new fruit stall that contains
all the fruits from both stalls.  The fruits in the new stall are
concatenated in the order they appear in the input stalls.

Write your code so that it behaves as follows:

```
jshell> /open Named.java
jshell> /open Perishable.java
jshell> /open Fruit.java
jshell> /open FruitStall.java
jshell> /open Q4.java

jshell> /open Fruits.jsh

jshell> FruitStall<Apple> fs1 = new FruitStall<>(List.of(new Apple(1), new Apple(9)))
fs1 ==>
- Apple (expires in 1 days)
- Apple (expires in 9 days)

jshell> FruitStall<Fruit> fs2 = new FruitStall<>(List.of(new Apple(2)))
fs2 ==>
- Apple (expires in 2 days)

jshell> Q4.mergeStalls(fs1, fs2)
$.. ==>
- Apple (expires in 1 days)
- Apple (expires in 9 days)
- Apple (expires in 2 days)

jshell> Q4.mergeStalls(fs1, new FruitStall<>())
$.. ==>
- Apple (expires in 1 days)
- Apple (expires in 9 days)

jshell> FruitStall<Fruit> fs = Q4.mergeStalls(fs1, fs2)
fs ==>
- Apple (expires in 1 days)
- Apple (expires in 9 days)
- Apple (expires in 2 days)

jshell> FruitStall<Apple> fs = Q4.mergeStalls(fs1, fs2)
|  Error:
|  incompatible types: inference variable U has incompatible bounds
|      equality constraints: Apple
|      lower bounds: Fruit,Apple
|  FruitStall<Apple> fs = Q4.mergeStalls(fs1, fs2);  // error
|                         ^----------------------^
```

## Question 5 (6 marks)

Write a static method `findUniqueFruitTypes` in a class `Q5` that takes a
list of fruit stalls and returns a list of unique fruit names sold at these
stalls, sorted in alphabetical order.

Write your code so that it behaves as follows (continuing from the examples
in Question 4):

```
jshell> /open Q5.java

jshell> FruitStall<Fruit> fs3 = new FruitStall<>(List.of(new Apple(8), new Mango()))
fs3 ==>
- Apple (expires in 8 days)
- Mango (expires in 4 days)

jshell> FruitStall<Mango> fs4 = new FruitStall<>(List.of(new Mango()))
fs4 ==>
- Mango (expires in 4 days)

jshell> Q5.findUniqueFruitTypes(List.of(fs1, fs2, fs3, fs4))
$.. ==> [Apple, Mango]

jshell> Q5.findUniqueFruitTypes(List.of(fs4, fs3, fs2, fs1))
$.. ==> [Apple, Mango]

jshell> Q5.findUniqueFruitTypes(List.of(fs4))
$.. ==> [Mango]
```

## Question 6 (6 marks)

Write a static method `consolidateStallsbyType` in a class `Q6` that takes
a list of fruit stalls and returns a list of new consolidated fruit stalls,
where each of the return fruit stalls contains the fruits of a particular
type. The order of the fruit stalls in the returned list should be the same
as the order of the unique fruit types sorted by their names.  The order of
fruits in each stall should be the same as the order in the original stall.
The input list can contain fruit stalls for different types of fruits, but
the return type must be `List<FruitStall<Fruit>>`.

Write your code so that it behaves as follows (continuing from the examples
in Question 5):

```
jshell> /open Q6.java

jshell> FruitStall<Devil> fs5 = new FruitStall<>(List.of(new Devil(), new Devil()))
fs5 ==>
- Devil (expires in 100000 days)
- Devil (expires in 100000 days)

jshell> Q6.consolidateStallsbyType(List.of(fs3, fs4, fs5))
$.. ==> [
- Apple (expires in 8 days)
,
- Devil (expires in 100000 days)
- Devil (expires in 100000 days)
,
- Mango (expires in 4 days)
- Mango (expires in 4 days)
]
```

## Question 7 (6 marks)

Write a generic class `Q7` that implements the `Comparator` interface that
allows comparison of two fruit stalls, to see which fruit stalls has the
shortest day to expiry among all their fruits.

Recall that the `Comparator` interface is defined as follows:

```Java
interface Comparator<T> {
  int compare(T o1, T o2);
}
```

where `compare` returns a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as
the first argument is less than, equal to, or greater than the second.

Write your code so that it behaves as follows (continuing from the examples
in Question 6):

```
jshell> /open Q7.java

jshell> new Q7<>().compare(fs3, fs4) == 0
$.. ==> true
jshell> new Q7<>().compare(fs4, fs5) < 0
$.. ==> true
jshell> new Q7<>().compare(fs5, fs4) > 0
$.. ==> true
```

Note: The value infinity and negative infinity are represented by
`Integer.MAX_VALUE` and `Integer.MIN_VALUE` in Java respectively.

## Question 8 (5 marks)

The rating of a fruit stall is proportional to the soonest expiry dates
among all the fruits sold at the stall.

Write a static method `sortByShortestExpiry` in a class `Q8` that takes a
list of fruit stalls and returns a list of fruit stalls sorted in ascending
order of the ratings.  If two stalls have the same rating, the order of the
stalls in the returned list should be the same as the order of the stalls
in the input list.

Write your code so that it behaves as follows (continuing from the examples
in Question 7):

```
jshell> /open Q8.java
jshell> Q8.sortByShortestExpiry(List.of(fs1, fs2, fs3, fs4, fs5))
$.. ==> [
- Apple (expires in 1 days)
- Apple (expires in 9 days)
,
- Apple (expires in 2 days)
,
- Apple (expires in 8 days)
- Mango (expires in 4 days)
,
- Mango (expires in 4 days)
,
- Devil (expires in 100000 days)
- Devil (expires in 100000 days)
]
```
